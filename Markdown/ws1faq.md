======================================
Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------

### HTML and CSS

*How do you render HTML files in the browser?*
Save a text file with HTML contents (proper tag structure) with the extension `.html` and double click on it to open it in the browser. Make changes and save them. Refresh the page in the browser to view updated changes!

*Can you re-use ids?*
IDs on HTML elements are supposed to be unique, so nope!

*Can you re-use classes?*
Yes! That's what they're for - assign classes to elements to apply a style toa  group of elements.

*Can you add is/classes to any kinds of element?*
Yes, you can. They're called 'attributes' and you can add them to whichever elements you like.

*What IDE are you using to code the HTML?*
Sublime Text 2/3 - it's a free open source text editor that lets you write code or even just plain text. Download links are on the tutorial page!

*How do you distinguish a class and id in CSS?*
Classes are identified by placing a period before the classname, like `.red-text`and ids are identified by placing a hashtag before the id like `#first-paragraph`.

### JavaScript in the browser

*Where is the JavaScript console?*
When you're using JavaScript in the browser, each browser uses its own console to display the output from your code. If you're working in a framework like NodeJS, your terminal will act as a console!

*What's the difference between single quotes and double quotes?*
There really isn't any difference when it comes to JavaScript. Both are used to represent Strings. Sometimes it's nice to use one over the other, but it's mainly personal choice and coding style. If you ask me, single quotes look much neater!

*How do functions really work in JavaScript?*
Functions are basically groups of commands that (may) take in input data, process it (join strings together, add two numbers etc etc) and give you an output. There are different ways to write functions in JavaScript. Think back to the example in the tutorials - the square function can be written a variety of different ways, each serving its own purpose. But really, they all do the same thing.


### Terminal/Command Line

*How do you go back in terminal?*
If you've `cd`'d your way into oblivion and made a wrong turn, it might help if you could climb back up that ladder. `cd ..` moves you up a level in your directory structure. Whew!
